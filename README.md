# Decision-Tree-Classifier

The project focuses on building a species classification model for Iris flowers using a Decision Tree Classifier. The Iris dataset contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
